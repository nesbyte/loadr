# Different types 
An overview of the different example folders in _example and what they show

| **name** | description |
|-|-|
|basic| Contains a basic project setup for parsing, error checking and rendering. Also shows how partials can be rendered|
|benchmark| Contains the benchmarks comparing std templates against loadr. The general rule is that loadr should not be slower than the naive usage of the std templates/html. |
|template_composition| Builds on top of basic and shows how template composition can be done (where you have one index file and multiple separate folders which share the same index template at root)|
